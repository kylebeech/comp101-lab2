\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hello, my name is Kyle Beech and I\'92m in my fourth year at Capilano University. I\'92m in the business program, majoring in Finance, and I took this class because I\'92m very interested in learning more about computers as I don\'92t know much, and feel like it is such a big thing in the world today. My biggest interest other than learning more in school would be sports, especially soccer, hockey, and baseball. I\'92ve played sports since I was young, and it has been such a big part of my life as I\'92ve had so many memories and made so many friends throughout the year.}
